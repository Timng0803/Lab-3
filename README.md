This project is a web mapping application visualizing the building permits in Calgary in a mapping front-end.  

After running the index.html file, users would get to a page where there is a map of Calgary, then they can either zoom in or zoom out to get a better view. Users can use the data range picker shown in the website to search for building permits in specific period. After clicking the search button, users can see several markers regarding the buliding permits in that specfic period in Calgary. After clicking the markers, the detailed information will be shown.
(When you zoom the page to a certain extent, some of the markers will be very close to each other. They will gather together and form a bubble with the number of spot agglomerated for better visualization. When you click on the bubble, the spot will spread out and users can see the all the markers)
